ADL - Abstract Definition Language

---

ADL is a generic language to describe hierarchical stuff, like software ;-)

...

Note: I'm trying to get things as polished as possible, but my current
focus is on a project that uses ADL. When that reaches a stable state,
I'll add documentation and examples here also :-)

In a nutshell:
$ make
*** fetching js/cc dist
*** unpacking js/cc dist
*** importing lib/jscc.js
*** importing lib/driver_web.js_
*** generating adl parser
*** fetching prototype dist
*** importing lib/prototype.js
$ ls build
adl.js
ls src/js/
adl.par		visitor.js

Visit examples/index.html with your browser to see things in action and
while waiting for me to write decent documentation, study the code.
