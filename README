ADL - Abstract Domain Language
http://thesoftwarefactory.be/wiki/ADL

---

ADL is a generic language to mostly describe hierarchical stuff, like
software ;-)

...

Note: I'm trying to get things as polished as possible, but my current
focus is on a project that uses ADL. When that reaches a stable state,
I'll add documentation and examples here also :-)

In a nutshell:
$ make
*** importing lib/jscc
*** importing lib/rhino1_7R1/js.jar
*** generating ADL parser
*** importing lib/prototype-1.6.0.3.js
*** building build/ADL.standalone.js
*** importing lib/yuicompressor-2.4.2/build/yuicompressor-2.4.2.jar
*** building build/ADL.standalone.min.js
*** building build/ADL.shared.min.js
*** generating ADL cli parser
$ ls build
ADL.cli.js            ADL.shared.min.js     ADL.standalone.min.js
ADL.shared.js         ADL.standalone.js

$ make test
*** importing lib/env-js/dist/env.rhino.js
*** running tests
3 tests run.
0 failed.

$ make dist
*** packaging ADL distribution
*** packaging ADL src distribution
$ ls dist
ADL-0.0-3-src.zip     ADL-0.0-3.zip     js                src


Visit examples/index.html with your browser to see things in action and
while waiting for me to write decent documentation, study the code.
